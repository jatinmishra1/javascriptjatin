//js engine works in three stages
//parsing--->compilation--->execution
//durign this parsing this code is broken into tokens
//and there is also known as synatx parser
//ans the job of syntax parser is to convert take this code and covert this into AST---i.e Abstract Syntax Tree


//then comes compilation and execution stage
//there are two things interpreter and compiler
//so js and used both as interpreter and copiler and thats why it is called as just in time cpilation laguage and it all depends on js engine
//how to use ,js can also be used only as compiler or interepreter or both
