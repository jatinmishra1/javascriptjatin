// debouncing ---is the difference b/w two keypress events is greater then only 300ms then only call the api
//throtlling  ---if there are lot of event happening ,then only make the function call after the certain period of the time
//let say various key press events happens ,so ignore all the events and functiona caling till certain period of time
// like just for 300ms

//in search bar scenario  debouncing is more efficient

//How many times user resizes window ...in this event throttlign is more efficient
//like in click events we also got for throttling
//Shooting game makes more sense in thorttling\


//also according to scrool you may want to call api in that scenario also we can got fordebouncing and throttling
